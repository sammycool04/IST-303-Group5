# IST-303-Group5


### PROJECT DESCRIPTION
FinalList is a web application that enables users to identify their ideal housing option. Users can generate their personalized housing lists based on their inputed parameters such as
* crime rate risk levels and proximity to area amenities (schools, grocery stores)
* recreation space (hiking and biking trails, parks, etc.) that
coincide with selected rental or sales ranges
*bedroom/bathroom combinations and other housing-related 
specifications.

### GROUP NAME:

### USER STORIES
* Any user should be able to search by location and property features only

* A registered user is able to save listings, contact housing hosts and access other web features on the web pages
* A user can make a change to their preferences without starting over
* A user can see both a map view and text listings of search results
* A user should be able to sort the listings based on their personalized rankings preference

### PARAMETERS WE COLLECT FROM USERS
* Distance to certain places, areas, etc...
* Price Preference
* Safety Level Preference
* Purpose: Sell, rent, or buy?
* Location

### PROJECT REQUIREMENTS:
User stories will be drafted and appropriately scheduled in order to organize related activities throughout
this project time-frame.  The user stories will center around requirements for what the user interface will 
include, what the web application ranking options will include, as well as accessiblity to the web application.
Data sources will be identified, validated, and documented to ensure that the web application is held up by 
by realistic data or inferred by real data.

### PROJECT CONCEPT PRESENTATION PART A FEEDBACK AND NEXT STEPS:
* Stakeholder feedback via survey responses from classmates will be sought. A survey will be drafted and distributed to 
  refine preference categories.
* propertyfinder.ae was suggested for review for ideas.
* Looking beyond API sources was suggested for data sources to ensure un-biased data is used.
* Query on what indexes will be used was brought up to offset implied or direct bias.
* Further exploration on how ranking (1 through 5 versus most importnat to least important, etc.) should be set to ensure
  the recommendations provided by the search is not too restrictive.

```
* Remember to keep your Postgres database running. In your terminal, type:
```
pytest
```
### LESSONS LEARNED: SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT
* Identify the most appropriate platform to develop and test your code and house your data as early as possible in the process.
* Refer back to the initial user stories to help stay focused on what drove the development in the first place.
* Have a clear idea of everyoneâ€™s roles are and have everyone actively take ownership of those roles but allow for some flexibility as needed in where help can be offered.
* Allow for learning in estimating hours. 
* Be flexible in what tools can be used and new ideas.
* Software development is a team effort.
* Agile methods are not always easy to adhere to if all team members are not on the same page, otherwise, staying agile would be effective.
